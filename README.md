# V3rmWrapper
A wrapper I made for v3rmillion.

This wrapper has userdata caching, this stores the userdata to the LUA_REGISRTYINDEX table and pulls it.

What this wrapper supports:
1. All Lua datatypes
2. Yielding
3. Function Handling
4. Globals
5. ScriptContext Scanner
6. Console Bypass

Will I be adding to this wrapper?
Yes of course I will, this is just the start.
This wrapper is kind of bad atm, but when I get more time I will be re-writing it
and even adding a internal IMGUI hook to it. I will also be adding custom functions and fixing
the random kicking from the game.

Do I need to credit you if I use this?
yes you do, just a small "Thanks robomat for the source" or "credits to robomat for the source" would work fine.

Is this skidded?
No this wrapper is not skidded, I will list all the code I have used from other developers.

1. Sloppeys Locateint3, but I can easily just use the direct pointer or a AOB.
2. Retcheck (I use eternal's open source retcheck bypass)
3. Lua Source (https://lua.org)
4. ScriptContext Scanner (I can't be asked to write my own, so I used one I found but I could easily write my own)

Is this the source for AtomWrapperX?
No this isn't AtomWrapperX is far more powerful than this.

Do you scan in your wrapper?
No I do not, I hook gettop and detour it to my function.

Will you keep this updated?
If I have time, I will try to update it, but its faily easy to update.

Anyway enjoy :)
